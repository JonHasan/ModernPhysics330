# Lab 4: Emission Spectrum 

This lab tasked me with finding the emission lines of hydrogen experimentally and then comparing it to the bohr model of hydrogen. This will be done for 
the first order diffraction for the four color bands and will follow the error propagation and uncertainty rules. 

Please follow the link below to be taken to the OSF notebook that details the analysis
