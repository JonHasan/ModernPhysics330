# Lab2: Millikan Oil Drop Experiment 

This experiment was performed in order to find the charge on the electron. This experiment was performed by Robert A. Millikan in order to immortalize his name
in science history. 

Simply put, using a force balance and Stokes Law, it was possible to find the total amount of charge on each droplet of oil. It was assumed that the electron was quantized,
so it was attempted to see if all the charge values were multiples of the same value. Follow the link below to go to the OSF notebook entry for this Lab
