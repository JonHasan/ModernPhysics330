# Lab 0b: Pendulum Lab 

This lab investigates the problem that transfixed Galileo. When a weight is held by a string and allowed to swing in an arc pattern solely under the influence of gravity, certain relations were found. Three different relations were available for investigation but my group chose to investigate whether the period of the pendulum was proprotional to the square root of the string length. 

This relation did in fact turn out to be true.
