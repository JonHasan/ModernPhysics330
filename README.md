GithubRepositoryForModernPhysics330 - Performing experiments that were considered pivotal in the physics discipline

# Lab 0b: The pendulum Lab 


# Lab 1: PhotoElectric Effect 

Second Lab in the Modern Physics Class

Detailing the photoelectric effect posited by Einstein with the assistance of Max planck's quantization revelation. 


# Lab 2: Millikan Oil Drop Experiment 

This lab tasked me with recreating the Millikan Oil Drop experiment which found the fundamental charge of the electron.

# Lab 3: Inverse PhotoElectric Effect 

## An experiment conducted by duane and hunt that seeks to reacquire the slope h/e which is found in all materials. 

# Lab 4: Emission Spectrum 

# Lab 5: Bragg Diffraction

# Lab 6 Double Slit Experiment
