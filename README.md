GithubRepositoryForModernPhysics330 - Performing experiments that were considered pivotal in the physics discipline

# Lab 0b: The pendulum Lab 


# Lab 1: PhotoElectric Effect 

Purpose: Detailing the photoelectric effect posited by Einstein with the assistance of Max planck's quantization revelation. 

# Lab 2: Millikan Oil Drop Experiment 

TPurpose: his lab tasked me with recreating the Millikan Oil Drop experiment which found the fundamental charge of the electron.

# Lab 3: Inverse PhotoElectric Effect 

Purpose:  An experiment conducted by duane and hunt that seeks to reacquire the slope h/e which is found in all materials. 

# Lab 4: Emission Spectrum 

Purpose: Experimentally determine the emission wavelengths and compare them to the Bohr Model of Hydrogen 

# Lab 5: Bragg Diffraction

Purpose: Investigate the Bragg Diffraction phenomenon resulting from bombarding a crystal lattice with X-rays 

# Lab 6 Double Slit Experiment 

Purpose: Investigate the dual wave nature of light
