# Lab 0b: The pendulum Lab 

Purpose: Replicates the experiments done by galileo and Christian Huygens in order to determine the relationship between string length and the period. 

Result: It was found that there was a linear relationship between the square root of the length and the Period of the pendulum. 

# Lab 1: PhotoElectric Effect 

Purpose: Detailing the photoelectric effect posited by Einstein with the assistance of Max planck's quantization revelation.

Result: Equation for energy was found to be $E = 3.68x - 1.08$. This linear relationship was expected. The h/e value was calculated to be $3.68 +/- .15 \frac{J}{PHz * C}. This differed from the true value of $4.14 \frac{J}{PHz * C}$ by 11.1%. 

# Lab 2: Millikan Oil Drop Experiment 

Purpose: This lab tasked me with recreating the Millikan Oil Drop experiment which tried to find the fundamental charge of the electron.

Result: Minimum charge is less than or equal to $19.5 * 10 ** -19 C$. ODR found a slope of 78.9 +/- 14.6 C/e. It doesn't agree with the established result. Must be because the number of assumed electrons is incorrect. 

# Lab 3: Inverse PhotoElectric Effect 

Purpose:  An experiment conducted by duane and hunt that seeks to reacquire the slope h/e which is found in all materials. 

# Lab 4: Emission Spectrum 

Purpose: Experimentally determine the emission wavelengths and compare them to the Bohr Model of Hydrogen 

# Lab 5: Bragg Diffraction

Purpose: Investigate the Bragg Diffraction phenomenon resulting from bombarding a crystal lattice with X-rays 

# Lab 6 Double Slit Experiment 

Purpose: Investigate the dual wave nature of light
